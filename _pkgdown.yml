      'Estimation' indicates that the methods to not employ Bayes factor testing. Rather,
      the graph is determined with the posterior distribution. The prior distribtuion has a
      minimal influence.

      is not a specific hypothesis being test.

      A variety of methods for comparing GGMs.
  - subtitle: "Posterior Predictive Check"
    desc: >
     Compare groups with a posterior predictive check, where the null model
     is that the groups are equal. This works with any number of groups. There
     is also an option to compare the groups with a user defined test-statistic.

  - subtitle: "Partial Correlation Differences"
    desc: >
     Pairwise comparisons for each partial correlation in the respective models.
     This can be used for any number of groups. There is also an analytical solution.
