The `R` package **BGGM** provides tools for making Bayesian inference in 
Gaussian graphical models [GGM, @williams2020bggm]. The methods are organized around 
two general approaches for Bayesian inference: (1) estimation and (2) hypothesis 
testing. The key distinction is that the former focuses on either the posterior or posterior 
predictive distribution [@Gelman1996a; see section 5 in @rubin1984bayesianly], whereas the 
latter focuses on model comparison with the Bayes factor [@Jeffreys1961; @Kass1995].

### <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i> Dealing with Errors
There are automatic checks for [**BGGM**](https://travis-ci.org/github/donaldRwilliams/BGGM/branches). However, that only checks for Linux and **BGGM** is built on Windows. 
The most common installation errors occur on OSX. An evolving guide to address these
issues is provided in the [Troubleshoot Section](https://donaldrwilliams.github.io/BGGM/articles/installation.html). 

## <i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Overview
The methods in **BGGM** build upon existing algorithms that are well-known in the literature.
The central contribution of **BGGM** is to extend those approaches:

1.  Bayesian estimation with the novel matrix-F prior distribution [@Mulder2018]
  
    + Estimation [@Williams2019]

2. Bayesian hypothesis testing with the matrix-F prior distribution [@Williams2019_bf]

    + [Exploratory hypothesis testing](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#Exploratory)
  
    + [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#confirmatory)
    
3. Comparing Gaussian graphical models [@Williams2019; @williams2020comparing]
    
    + [Partial correlation differences](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#partial-correlation-differences)
    
    + [Posterior predictive check](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#posterior-predictive-check)
    
    + [Exploratory hypothesis testing](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#exploratory-groups)
    
    + [Confirmatory hypothesis testing](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#confirmatory-groups)

4. Extending inference beyond the conditional (in)dependence structure [@Williams2019]

    +  [Predictability](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#predictability)
    
    +  [Posterior uncertainty intervals](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#posterior-uncertainty) for the 
       partial correlations
       
    +  [Custom Network Statistics](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/BGGM#custom-network-statistics)
    
    
The computationally intensive tasks are written in `c++` via the `R` package **Rcpp** [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] and the `c++` library **Armadillo** [@sanderson2016armadillo]. The Bayes factors are computed with the `R` package **BFpack** [@mulder2019bfpack]. Furthermore, there are plotting functions
for each method, control variables can be included in the model (e.g., `~ gender`), 
and there is support for missing values (see `bggm_missing`).

## Supported Data Types

* **Continuous**: The continuous method was described in  @Williams2019. Note that 
                  this is based on the customary [Wishart distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishart_distribution).

* **Binary**: The binary method builds directly upon @talhouk2012efficient
  that, in turn, built upon the approaches of @lawrence2008bayesian and
  @webb2008bayesian (to name a few).
  
* **Ordinal**: The ordinal methods require sampling thresholds. There are two approach 
   included in **BGGM**. The customary approach described in @albert1993bayesian 
   (the default) and the 'Cowles' algorithm described in @cowles1996accelerating.
   
* **Mixed**: The mixed data (a combination of discrete and continuous) method was introduced
 in @hoff2007extending. This is a semi-parametric copula model
 (i.e., a copula GGM) based on the ranked likelihood. Note that this can be used for 
 *only* ordinal data (not restricted to "mixed" data).


##  <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Illustrative Examples
There are several examples in the [Vignettes](https://donaldrwilliams.github.io/BGGM/articles/) section.

## <i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Basic Usage
It is common to have some combination of continuous and discrete (e.g., ordinal, binary, etc.) variables. **BGGM** (as of version `2.0.0`) can readily be used for these kinds of data. In this example, a model is fitted for the `gss` data in **BGGM**. 

### Visualize
The data are first visualized with the **psych** package, which readily shows the data are "mixed". 

```r
# dev version
library(BGGM)
library(psych)

# data
Y <- gss

# histogram for each node
psych::multi.hist(Y, density = FALSE)
```
![](man/figures/index_hist.png)




### Fit Model
A Gaussian copula graphical model is estimated as follows
```r
fit <- estimate(Y, type = "mixed")
```
`type` can be `continuous`, `binary`, `ordinal`, or `mixed`. Note that `type` is a misnomer, as the data can consist of *only* ordinal variables (for example).


### Summarize Relations
The estimated relations are summarized with
```r
summary(fit)

The summary can also be plotted
```r
plot(summary(fit))
```
![](man/figures/index_summ.png)

### Graph Selection
The graph is selected and plotted with
```r
E <- select(fit)

plot(E, node_size = 12,
     edge_magnify = 5)
```

The Bayes factor testing approach is readily implemented by changing `estimate` to `explore`.
