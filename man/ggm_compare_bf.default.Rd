\usage{
\method{ggm_compare_bf}{default}(..., prior_sd = 0.35, iter = 25000,
  cores = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{data matrices (\emph{n} by  \emph{p}). Requires at least two.}

\item{prior_sd}{hypothesized standard deviation for the edges or partial correlations.}

\item{iter}{number of posterior samples.}

\item{cores}{number of cores for parallel computing. The default is 2, but this can be adjusted.}
}
\value{
list of class \code{ggm_compare_bf}
\itemize{
\item \code{BF_01} Bayes factors in favor of the null hypothesis
\item \code{p} number of variables
\item  \code{info} list of information about the data matrices

\itemize{
\item \code{dat} list containing the data matrices
\item \code{dat_info} sample size for each data matrix
\item \code{pairwise} matrix of pairwise combinations
}
\item \code{iter} number of posterior and prior samples
\item \code{call} match.call()
\item \code{delta} hyperparameter of matrix-F prior distribution (corresponds to \code{prior_sd})
}
}
\description{
Compare GGMs with the Bayes factor. This method allows for
assessing (relative) evidence for edge equality or edges differences across any number of groups. Further, confirmatory hypothesis testing
can be used to test predictions or expectations regarding difference or similarities in different groups (e.g., male vs. female).
}
\note{
After fitting, use \code{select} to determine which partial correlations were different or the same (i.e., evidence for the null hypothesis of
equality). This assumes \code{hypothesis = NULL}. If a hypothesis is tested, then use \code{summary} which provides
information including the Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for each hypothesis.

\examples{

# assume null is true
Y1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(500, rep(0, 16), Sigma = diag(16))
Y2 <- MASS::mvrnorm(500, rep(0, 16), Sigma = diag(16))
Y3 <- MASS::mvrnorm(500, rep(0, 16), Sigma = diag(16))

bf_ggm <- ggm_compare_bf(Y1, Y2, Y3, prior_sd = .5, iter = 500, cores = 2)
