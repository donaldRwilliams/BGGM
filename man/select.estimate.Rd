\title{Graph Selection for \code{estimate} Objects}
\usage{
\method{select}{estimate}(object, cred = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{estimate.default}.}

\item{cred}{Numeric. The credible interval width for selecting the graph
(defaults to 0.95; must be between 0 and 1).}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis. It
must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater"  or "less".
See note for futher details.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
The returned object of class \code{select.estimate} contains a lot of information that
        is used for printing and plotting the results. For users of \strong{BGGM}, the following
        are the useful objects:

\itemize{

\item \code{pcor_adj} Selected partial correlation matrix (weighted adjacency).
\item \code{adj} Adjacency matrix for the selected edges
\item \code{object} An object of class \code{estimate} (the fitted model).

}
}
\description{
Provides the selected graph based on credible intervals for
the partial correlations that did not contain zero

\details{
This package was built for the social-behavioral sciences in particular. In these applications, there is
strong theory that expects \emph{all} effects to be positive. This is known as a "positive manifold" and
this notion has a rich tradition in psychometrics. Hence, this can be incorportated into the graph with
\code{alternative = "greater"}. This results in the estimted structure including only positive edges. Further
details can be found at the blog "Dealing with Negative (Red) Edges in Psychological Networks: Frequentist Edition"
